## üõ†Ô∏è How This Was Created

**Asset Decoding**: The **[sc-file](https://github.com/onejeuu/sc-file)** application was utilized for extracting icons and other assets.

**Map Merging**: Location maps were consolidated into single images using the **[sc-mapmerge](https://github.com/onejeuu/sc-mapmerge)** utility.
